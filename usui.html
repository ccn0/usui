USUI is a JS library I made to create floating popup windows on the page, originally designed for my userscripts.
Currently none of my public userscripts make use of this, as currently its in a very very early beta stage of development.
That's also why none of the links work.
You shouldn't be able to see this page, and if you do, hello!
You're quite curious aren't you? Not like you stumbled onto this page.
You would've had to find this URL! Maybe you know me more than I think.
        </p>
        <h2>
            What is this?
        </h2>
        <p>
This serves as a sort of test page for it's features. There are many parameters you can add to a popup.
For instance, the <code>fencing</code> parameter makes it so the window can never leave the screen. Try it,
drag this window off of the screen.
